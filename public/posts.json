Want a custom hero, pricing section, FAQ layout? Done. Export, reuse, flex.</p><h3>Cleaner, Faster Front-End</h3><p>Block themes + server-side rendering = performance that loads faster than Reels on 5G.</p><h3>Better SEO & Clean Markup</h3><p>No spaghetti shortcodes, no mystery divs. Blocks = clean HTML Google actually loves.</p><h2>Developer Freedom</h2><p>Drag-and-drop UI meets pro dev vibes — React components, PHP render callbacks, scoped CSS, and peace of mind.</p><h3>TL;DR</h3><p>Classic editor = nostalgia. Gutenberg = the future. If you’re still clinging to the old editor like it’s BBM Messenger, it's time to let go. Blocks didn’t just win — they reshaped WordPress.</p>"

SQL injection attacks aren't retro; they're chaos.</p><h3>Rate Limiting & Monitoring</h3><p>Add rate limits and log behavior — because someone will try to stress test your app for fun.</p><h2>Security Best Practices</h2><ul><li>Always use HTTPS</li><li>Rotate keys regularly</li><li>Add secure headers</li><li>Log safely (no sensitive data leaks)</li></ul><h3>Bottom Line</h3><p>Security is the first feature, not the last thought. Build stable, secure APIs — or don’t build at all.</p>"
